# 30 days of web Animations
Hello there, fellas. <br />
My name is Manish Karki. I am now working as a frontend developer. I like it when a website isn't static, and I'd like to make my websites interactive as well. So I began my journey to master online animation. During this journey, I plan to learn about web animations using just CSS or a javascript library like GSAP.

## Day 1: 2d animation with transition
Today is the first day and I will be doing some 2d animation with the help of transition property of CSS. transition property allow us to create simple animations between two states. for example if we wanna move a box from one place to another we can do that with transition property.
**Syntax**:
```CSS
transition: transition-element | transition-duration | transition-timing-function | transition-delay;
```
> **Transition-element** : our targeted transition element. all | tags | classes
> 
> **transition-duration** : how long the animation gonna last. value are time values.
>
> **transition-timing-function** : how our transition gonna be executed. speed/acceleration of the transition. Values are linear , ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out and curbic-bezier-function.
>
> **transition-delay** : time after which the transition will be started. value are time values.
